      <p class="lead">Ford’s long awaited Mk2 RS2000 was launched at the 1975 Earls Court show.
        It was the most luxurious of the sporting Escorts of the time, and was powered by an
        uprated version of the 2.0-litre OHC Pinto unit employed in the Capri, Cortina and Granada</p>

          Tuneable, fun and seriously cool, the Mk2 Escort RS2000 ticks all the boxes…
          Older performance cars, classics if you want to call them that, are usually treated as
          museum pieces to look at and admire, but are rarely used hard.
          In some respects we understand that as they are very valuable and rare,
          fixing them or replacing a destroyed one comes at huge expense,
          but for us this always seems a waste.
          There are exceptions to this rule in all cars, but the number one is the Mk2 Escort RS2000,
          a car that is over 40 years old and commands serious money, but is far more commonly seen
          squatting under hard acceleration or sideways in a cloud of tyre smoke than it is being polished up for
          display.
          First appearing in 1976, even today the Mk2 Escort RS2000 ticks all the boxes for a fun and affordable
          performance car.
          Two-litre engine, rear-wheel drive, 950kg, cool styling inside and out,
          and eye watering paintwork options that makes the current Focus RS and ST colours look tame;
          it’s clear why the RS2K was the number one car to tune in the late 70s and 80s.
