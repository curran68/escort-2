        <p>
          Like the Mk1 Escort Mexico, the Mk2 Mexico was a special edition model that offered a number of performance upgrades over the regular Escort. 
          At the heart of the Mk2 Mexico was a 1,600cc Ford Pinto engine outputting 95hp.
          As a side note, the ‘Mexico’ name comes from the Escort’s success on the 1970 London to Mexico World Cup Rally – 
          an epic 16,000-mile-long (25,700km) trek through Europe and South America. 
          The event started at Wembley Stadium, where England won its first football world championship at the 1966 FIFA World Cup, 
          and ended in Mexico City a few days before the start of the 1970 FIFA World Cup. The rally’s winners? Hannu Mikkola and Gunnar Palm, 
          in an Escort of course.
